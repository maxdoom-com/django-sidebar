# Django Sidebar as app

This is a very simple and minimal implementation of a sidebar for django.
It contains a app "adminoverrides" that loads a custom css file and overrides
the template "admin/base.html".

## Installation

- copy adminoverrides/ to your applications root directory and
- add 'adminoverrides.apps.AdminoverridesConfig' to your INSTALLED_APPS


## Tested with

- Django 1.9.5

## Licensing

- None. I don't mind.
- No warranties at all!
